## Features

For development speed I stuck with technologies I was comfortable with, namely React, TypeScript, and Vercel for deployment.

## Dependencies

## Approach

My approach to this challenge revolved around four key principles I believe the app should be â€” mobile-first, accessible, user-centric, and thoroughly tested.

- Custom hooks
- Debouncing
  - To minimize # of API calls

## Extensions/Improvements

- Performance
- Better use of Polaris
- Developer workflow improvements
