# Shopify Frontend Internship Challenge - Summer 2021

![The Shoppies demo video](demo.gif)

<p align="center">
A small web app to nominate your favourite movies for the upcoming The Shoppies award show üéâ
</p>

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo ‚Äî `git clone https://github.com/narendrasss/TheShoppies`
2. Install dependencies ‚Äî `yarn install`
3. Add a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) key:

```
/.env.local

REACT_APP_OMDB_API_KEY=my_api_key
```

4. Start the app ‚Äî `yarn start`
5. Run tests ‚Äî `yarn test`

## Features üéä

### Technical Requirements

- Search for movies using the OMDb API
- Nominate your favourite movies
- Limit nominations to five movies, and show a banner when the user's done

### Extras

- **Responsive** ‚Äî The app was built mobile-first with a responsive design. For mobile users, I created a slightly modified design using tabs to improve user experience.
- **Micro-interactions** ‚Äî I added various micro-interactions to make the app feel more smooth. This includes loading animations and an animation when a movie is nominated or removed.
- **Polaris** ‚Äî As much as possible I used Shopify's Polaris component library to build the markup. For custom components, I made sure to style them so they don't look out of place.
- **100% statement coverage** ‚Äî I added a comprehensive integration testing suite using [react testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to ensure the app is accessible and works well.

## Considerations üèó

### Minimize API calls

I structured the app to **minimize the number of API calls**. For myself this means I'm not likely to be blocked by OMDb's daily rate limit, and for a company like Shopify, this means lower costs from vendors who charge on a per-request basis. At the same time I wanted the results to update in real time as I type for a seamless experience.

To do this, I added a `useEffect` that makes requests as the user types. This call is _debounced_, meaning it only runs once the user stops typing for a set amount of time. See [the code here](https://github.com/narendrasss/TheShoppies/blob/a814412df2279abeb62493745afa2eea03a8a08a/src/components/MovieResults.tsx#L42-L52).

The trade-off here is there's no immediate feedback and there's a slight delay when the user stops typing.

### Composition

I wanted the components to be as composable as possible. Having composable components means building future screens is straightforward and requires minimal changes. Using Polaris, most of the components already are, however I wanted the custom components to follow a similar API.

For the [Tabs component](src/components/Tabs.tsx), I designed an API that allows users to add their own `Tab`s as children. This means the component itself is only responsible for maintaining the active state, with little opinion on how it should be presented.

The trade-off here is that the complexity is swallowed up by the `Tabs` component, meaning the implementation is more complex than if `Tabs` just accepted the names as a prop.

## Technologies üõ†

For development speed I stuck with technologies I was comfortable with, namely **Create-React-App** and **TypeScript** for development, and Vercel for deployment. For a complete list of packages, see the table below.

### Dependencies

**Runtime Dependencies**

| Package                                      | Purpose                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `react`, `react-dom`, `react-scripts`        | Primary front-end framework and associated tooling.                                                                                                                |
| `@shopify/polaris`, `@shopify/polaris-icons` | Component library to match Shopify design.                                                                                                                         |
| `styled-components`                          | CSS-in-JS library, personal preference and have used multiple times in other projects.                                                                             |
| `framer-motion`                              | React animation library. Chosen over other options because of its declarative API and experience with using it.                                                    |
| `use-debounce`                               | Custom React hook to debounce a function. I didn't feel it was necessary to write my own debounce function ‚Äî the package has a nice API and is extensively tested. |

**Development Dependencies**

| Package              | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| TypeScript           | Who doesn't love static typing? TS also works very well with React.                                                                                                            |
| Prettier             | Automatic code formatting for consistency throughout the codebase.                                                                                                             |
| `@testing-library/*` | Various packages for integration tests. I chose this over a library like `enzyme` because it enforces a11y best practices and allows you to write very robust front-end tests. |

The following packages came with create-react-app, but I thought it would be useful to mention them as well:

| Package | Purpose                                                           |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Eslint  | Code linter, ensures code abides by best practices.               |
| Jest    | Comprehensive test runner with support for mocks and async tests. |

## Trade-Offs üîç

- Using `styled-components` can cause longer load times because it adds additional runtime code that needs to be bundled and sent to the user. For speed of development, I used it nevertheless because I wanted to be able to write my css in the same file as the components themselves. As an alternative I would probably use CSS Modules.

## Extensions/Improvements ü§î

### Features

- **Add pagination** ‚Äî For simplicity, I currently limit the movie results to the only the first page. In some cases this can lead to users not finding the movies they're looking for.

### Performance

- **Request optimization** ‚Äî The number of API calls can be further optimized using memoization. By saving the previous responses and the queries associated with that response, we can prevent another request coming out if a user types that response again.
- **Animation performance** ‚Äî While Framer Motion is implemented with GPU-accelerated animations whenever possible, it can still lead to jittery animations on slower machines (this includes my iPhone, despite being a new generation phone). Currently I have the animations off on mobile, however it's better to have it off whenever the user has that setting on in their browser (using the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query).

### Code Improvements

- **Better use of Polaris** ‚Äî Admittedly this was my first project using Polaris, so in some places I may have used the library incorrectly. An example of this is the `Tabs` component, where I implemented my own because I wasn't able to customize the Polaris `Tabs` in the particular way I wanted to.

### Developer Workflow

- **Automatic linting and formatting** ‚Äî Currently the code is formatted through the Eslint and Prettier extension for VSCode. For teams, a better approach would be to set a script to run the linter and formatter on each commit. This can be done using something like [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged).
- **Automatic testing with CI** ‚Äî Continuous deployment is already configured for this repo using Vercel's GitHub integration, but a useful complement to this would be to run tests automatically on each commit. I would probably implement this using GitHub actions.
